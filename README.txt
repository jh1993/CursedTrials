PLEASE CHECK THE DISCORD THREAD FOR UPDATE NOTICES, AND RE-DOWNLOAD THE MOD WHENEVER THERE'S AN UPDATE.

To install this mod, click on the green "Code" button on this page, then "Download ZIP". Please rename the "MoreTrials-main" folder to "MoreTrials" before putting it into your mods folder.

This mod adds several new archmage trials, some of which are meant to be somewhat humorous in theme yet also provide legitimate, mechanically interesting challenges.

My Bugfixes mod is recommended to make the trial descriptions display properly instead of being cut off at the bottom of the screen.
